# Example Code: Prototype

## Jump to Code :keyboard:

- [main.cpp](C++/src/main.cpp)
- [PrototypeFactory.hpp](C++/include/PrototypeFactory.hpp)
- [ConcretePrototypes.hpp](C++/include/ConcretePrototypes.hpp)
- [Prototype.hpp](C++/include/Prototype.hpp)

I recommend you look at the files in top-down order.

## Concept :dart:

This Prototype class illustrates the structure of the Prototype Design Pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

- What classes does it consist of?
- What roles do these classes play?
- In what way are the elements of the pattern related?
