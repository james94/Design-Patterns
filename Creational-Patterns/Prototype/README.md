# Prototype

## Concept :dart:

**Prototype** is a _creational design pattern_ that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without making your code depedent on their specific classes.

All prototype classes should have a common interface that makes it possible to copy objects if their concrete classes are unknown. Prototype objects can produce full copies since objects of the same class can access each other's private fields.

## Usage of the pattern in C++

**Complexity**: :star:

**Popularity**: :star: :star:

**Usage example**: The Prototype pattern is available in C++ out of the box with a `Cloneable` interface.

**Identification**: The prototype can be easily recognized by a `clone` or `copy` methods, etc.
