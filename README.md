# Design-Patterns

Design Patterns description and implementation

## Creational Patterns

Abstract Factory - 3

Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes

Builder - 3

Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Factory Method - 3

Provides an interface for creating objects in a superlcass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created

Prototype - 2

Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes

Singleton - 2

Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
