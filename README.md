# Design-Patterns

Design Patterns description and implementation

## Creational Patterns

### Abstract Factory :star: :star: :star:

Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes

### Builder :star: :star: :star:

Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### Factory Method :star: :star: :star:

Provides an interface for creating objects in a superlcass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created

### Prototype :star: :star:

Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes

### Singleton :star: :star:

Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
